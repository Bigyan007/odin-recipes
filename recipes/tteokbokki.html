    <br><strong>Tteokbokki is chewy rice cakes cooked in a red, spicy broth. It’s a popular Korean street food.</strong></br>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound of cylinder shaped rice cake (tteok), bought or homemade. (Use a little more if you’re not adding hard<br> boiled eggs and fish cakes)</br></li>
    <li>4 cups of water</li>
    <li>7 large size dried anchovies, with heads and intestines removed</li>
    <li>6 x 8 inch dried kelp</li>
    <li>⅓ cup hot pepper paste (gochujang)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru) aka “Korean chili flakes”</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>3 green onions (scallions), cut into 3 inch long pieces</li>
    <li>2 hard boiled eggs, shelled (optional)</li>
    <li>½ pound fish cakes (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>

   <em> <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dried kelp to a shallow pot or pan.</li>
    <br></br>
    <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without the lid.</li>
    <br></br>
    <li>Combine gochujang (hot pepper paste), gochugaru (hot pepper flakes), and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the<br> anchovies and kelp from the pot and add the rice cake, the mixture in the bowl, the green onion, and the optional<br> fish cakes and hard boiled eggs. The stock will be about 2½ cups.</li>
    <br></br>
   <li>Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Let it simmer and keep stirring until the rice cake turns<br> soft and the tteokbokki sauce thickens and looks shiny, which should take about 10 to 15 minutes. If the rice cake <br>is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring until it softens. When you use freshly made rice cake, it takes<br> shorter time. If you use frozen rice cake, thaw it out and soak in cold water to soften it before cooking.</li>
<br></br>
    <li>Remove from the heat and serve hot. If you have any leftovers, just keep them in the fridge and reheat them when you <br>want to eat. You should finished it in a few days.</li></br>
